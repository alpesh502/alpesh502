## 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m a **BTech 3rd-year CSE (AIML)** student with a strong interest in **data engineering and analytics systems**.

I enjoy working on projects that go beyond basic demos and focus on:
- How data pipelines work in real environments  
- How raw data is ingested, cleaned, and transformed at scale  
- How engineering decisions impact reporting and business use cases
